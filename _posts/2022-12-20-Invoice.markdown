#### Project Introduction
Hello there. 

If you happened to stumbled apon this archive then first let me introduce myself, my name is **Liam**. 

I am a passionate hobbyist software developer who like to make sofware that I find could be potentially useful to myself or others, but mostly, I make these projects as a personal learning experience.

I want to use this platform to archive my journey throughout the many future project I hope to preserve on this website. ðŸ™‚ 

Now that we are _acquainted_.

For this project, I wanted to make a mobile application made using the **[ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)** framework, a useful tool that will come in handy when making a cross platform mobile application and one I wanted to learn for many future mobile projects. 

I wanted to make an app that would be both simple to use and useful to my everyday life.

So first off, a little background knowledge. As a contractor for a building company, I myself, am required to email my employer, at minimum, a readable file that details the hours, days and pay rate of every week I work with a total amount owed (with tax deducted ofcourse). When it comes to trying to write up a spreadsheet every week, if I'm honest, it's not a very difficult task, infact in some cases I could just copy and paste my previous invoice if there weren't many changes between weeks.

**However**, after hundreds of invoices manually sent by email week after week, it can start to get a little tedious.

My initial drafted idea, simply enough, was an app that could automatically generate those weekly invoices, even if it only saves me a marginal amount of time per week...

**Note:** This project is purely for my personal education, and I do not intend to monetize it in anyway. The source code and resources are all on my github and is all open source
